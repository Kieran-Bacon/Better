# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2019/05/12 - update the ConfigParser

### Added

- Add change log for the package (hence why this is the first entry).
- Extend the type system within the ConfigParser to handle and accept sub type casting of settings.
- Add functionality to write a config's contents to file. Writing retains types of the items as best as can be.
